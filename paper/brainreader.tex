\begin{abstract}
Previous work in decoding visual experiences based on fMRI activity has been successful in reconstructing images and movies that participants viewed inside an MRI scanner. Reconstruction is done by fitting a forward model that predicts fMRI activity across the brain in response to a set of movies. The model represents brain activity as a linearized function of visual information features that capture the structure of the movies (spatiotemporal Gabor wavelet filters). The forward model is then inverted and used to decode what the subject saw based on their brain responses to a testing set of movies. Decoding is performed by fitting a maximum a posteriori function to a large library of previously unseen movie clips. The top 100 decoded movie clips are then averaged or stitched together to produce a visualization of the decoding. Though the decoding is quite precise when measured quantitatively, these visualizations do not fully reflect its accuracy. We make the visualization more coherent by combining the decoded clips in several improved ways. First, we demonstrate the change in quality gained using weighted averaging.  Then, we use HOG features to select a subset clips similar to the ground truth clip and SIFT flow to find an optimal path in time. Third, we use appearance morphing to visually align the path-arranged clips. Finally, we share the decoded movies resulting from the same stimuli across different participants in the experiment.

The authors would like to thank Alyosha, Shiry, and Shubham for being generally awesome, teaching neat material, and giving suggestions on the project.  What a fun semester!\\
We would also like to thank the Gallant lab, in particular Shinji Nishimoto, for providing us with the data necessary for this project.
